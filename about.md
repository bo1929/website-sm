I am an assistant professor at the [ECE](http://ece.ucsd.edu) department, [University of California, San Diego](http://ucsd.edu), where I have been a faculty member since the summer of 2015. In addition to my home department, I am affiliated with the [CSE department](http://cse.ucsd.edu/), [Bioinformatics](http://bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/faculty_bisb), and [Center for Microbiome Innovation](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/microbiome/faculty.sfe).
I obtained my Ph.D. from the Computer Science department at UT-Austin and was advised by [Prof. Tandy Warnow](http://tandy.cs.illinois.edu) and [Prof. Keshav Pingali](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pingali/). 

My Ph.D. research was supported by an NSERC PGS award and [Howard Hughes Medical Institute international student fellowship](http://www.hhmi.org/news/20120725.html). My [dissertation](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/31377/MIRARABBAYGI-DISSERTATION-2015.pdf) won the [honorable mention for the 2015 ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award](http://www.acm.org/awards/2015-doctoral-dissertation) and I am recipient of the [2017 Sloan Research Fellowship](https://sloan.org/fellowships/2017-Fellows) in Computational & Evolutionary Molecular Biology.

My [research](research.html) area is **computational biology** and my lab develops methods that target large-scale datasets. 
My specific areas of research span many topics, including, reconstruction of species trees from gene trees (phylogenomics),
large-scale multiple sequence alignment, HIV transmission network reconstruction, and metagenomic analyses using phylogenetic approaches.


**Hiring:**

- We are now hiring a [postdoc]({{ site.url }}/2016/06/14/postdocCNIHR.html) for a project related to HIV.
- Students admitted to the UCSD Ph.D. programs in ECE, CSE, or Bioinformatics interested in my [research](research.html) should contact me. 

Check out my [publications](publications.html) page for the list of recent and old papers, and look at the [news](news.html) for miscellaneous information. 
Here is my (hopefully up-to-date) [**CV**]({{ site.url }}/assets/resume-mirarab.pdf).
And my (hopefully up-to-date) calendar:
