I am an assistant professor at the [ECE](http://ece.ucsd.edu) department, [University of California at San Diego](http://ucsd.edu), where I have been a faculty member since the summer of 2015. Before that, I was a PhD student, working under the supervision of [Prof. Tandy Warnow](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~tandy/) and [Prof. Keshav Pingali](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pingali/), working on large-scale phylogenetics. My PhD research was supported through a NSERC PGS award and [Howard Hughes Medical Institute international student fellowship](http://www.hhmi.org/news/20120725.html).

I work in the area of **computational biology**, more specifically large scale phylogenetics. My research spans many topics, in particular estimation of species trees from gene trees (phylogenomics), large scale multiple sequence alignment, and metagenomic analysis using phylogenetic placement. 

Here is my (hopefully up-to-date) [**CV**](resume-mirarab.pdf).
