* Assistant Professor
* [ECE](http://ece.ucsd.edu) Department, [University of California, San Diego](http://ucsd.edu)
* Affiliated with the [CSE department](http://cse.ucsd.edu/), [Bioinformatics](http://bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/faculty_bisb), and [Center for Microbiome Innovation](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/microbiome/faculty.sfe).
* [2017 Sloan Research Fellow](https://sloan.org/fellowships/2017-Fellows)

I obtained my Ph.D. from the Computer Science department at UT-Austin and was advised by [Prof. Tandy Warnow](http://tandy.cs.illinois.edu) and [Prof. Keshav Pingali](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pingali/). My Ph.D. research was supported by an NSERC PGS award and [Howard Hughes Medical Institute international student fellowship](http://www.hhmi.org/news/20120725.html). My [dissertation](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/31377/MIRARABBAYGI-DISSERTATION-2015.pdf) won the [honorable mention for the 2015 ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award](http://www.acm.org/awards/2015-doctoral-dissertation) and I am recipient of the [2017 Sloan Research Fellowship](https://sloan.org/fellowships/2017-Fellows) in Computational & Evolutionary Molecular Biology.

My [research](research.html) area is **computational biology** and my lab develops methods that target large-scale datasets. 
My specific areas of research span many topics, including, reconstruction of species trees from gene trees (phylogenomics),
large-scale multiple sequence alignment, HIV transmission network reconstruction, and metagenomic analyses using phylogenetic approaches.


Check out my [publications](publications.html) page for the list of recent and old papers, and look at the [news](news.html) for miscellaneous information. 
Here is my (hopefully up-to-date) [**CV**]({{ site.url }}/assets/resume-mirarab.pdf).

* Prospective students are generally discouraged from contacting me directly regarding addmissions; those decisions are made by a committee in our department.  In rare circumistances, if you have done work that is very closely related to my work, you can write to me and bring that to my attention.  
* Incoming and new students are encouraged to check out [this page]({{ site.url }}/2015/09/12/material-for-prospective-students.html) to learn about the background used in my work 
* ECE students without sufficient programming backgrond may find [this page]({{ site.url }}/2017/03/26/programming.html) useful.
