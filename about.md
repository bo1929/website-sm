I am an assistant professor at the [ECE](http://ece.ucsd.edu) department, [University of California, San Diego](http://ucsd.edu), where I have been a faculty member since the summer of 2015. Before that, I was a Ph.D. student advised by [Prof. Tandy Warnow](http://tandy.cs.illinois.edu) and [Prof. Keshav Pingali](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pingali/), working on large-scale phylogenetics. My Ph.D. research was supported by an NSERC PGS award and [Howard Hughes Medical Institute international student fellowship](http://www.hhmi.org/news/20120725.html), 
and my [dissertation]() won the [honorable mention for the 2015 ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award](http://www.acm.org/awards/2015-doctoral-dissertation).

I work on **computational biology**, developing methods that target large-scale datasets. My specific areas of research spans many topics, in particular, estimation of species trees from gene trees (phylogenomics), large-scale multiple sequence alignment, and metagenomic analysis using phylogenetic placement. 

Here is my (hopefully up-to-date) [**CV**]({{ site.url }}/assets/resume-mirarab.pdf).
