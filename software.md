## Datasets

Refer to [this site](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/datasets/home) for most of the datasets we have published through years.     

## Software

* See my [gitub page](https://github.com/smirarab) to see all my publicly available software programs.
  These are most from my days as a graduate student advised by [Tandy Warnow](http://tandy.cs.illinois.edu), but some have been updated by my lab. 
    * [ASTRAL](https://github.com/smirarab/ASTRAL): Species tree estimation from unrooted gene trees using a quartet-based approach (consistent under multi-species coalescent process and hence useful for handling gene tree incongruence caused by ILS). 
	* Other developers: Chao Zhang, Maryam Rabiee, John Yin, and Erfan Sayyari.
    * [PASTA](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~phylo/software/pasta/): Software for alignment and tree estimation on very large datasets (thousands to hundreds of thousands of sequences). This is a new version of SATé, and the code is heavily based on the SATé code. 
	* Other developers: Uyen Mai, Kodi Collins
    * [SEPP](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~phylo/software/sepp/submission/): Software for fast phylogenetic placement based on SATe decomposition - useful for metagenomic analyses
	* Other developers: Nam Nguyen, Mike G Nute, Stefan Janssen
    * [TIPP](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~phylo/software/sepp/tipp-submission): Taxonomic identification and taxonomic profiling of metagenomic samples (uses SEPP). 
	* Other developers: Nam Nguyen, Mike G Nute
    * [UPP](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~phylo/software/upp/): Ultra-large alignments using Phylogeny-aware Profiles (uses SEPP). 
	* Other developers: Nam Nguyen, Uyen Mai
    * [FastSP](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~smirarab/fastsp): Fast and Memory efficient software for comparison of multiple sequence alignments (computes SP-FN and TC scores) 
    * [Statistical binning](https://github.com/smirarab/binning): the code to perform statistical binning
    * [Misc](https://github.com/smirarab/global): a patchwork of scripts for phylogenetics and MSA that may be useful to others
* Also checkout the following github pages from students in the lab.
    * [Uyen Mai](https://github.com/uym2):
        * [Minimum Variance (MV) rooting](https://github.com/uym2/MinVar-Rooting): also includes an efficient implementation of the MP rooting
        * [tripVote](https://github.com/uym2/tripVote)
        * [TreeShrink](https://github.com/uym2/TreeShrink): a tool for detecting extremely and suspiciously long branches on a (set of) tree(s)
        * [LogDate](https://github.com/uym2/LogDate): dating phylogenies using log transformation 
    * [Erfan](https://github.com/esayyari): 
        * [DISTIQUE](https://esayyari.github.io/DISTIQUE.html): species tree inference using distance
        * [DiscoVista](https://github.com/esayyari/DiscoVista): A visualization tool for showing discordance among gene trees and species trees
        * [TADA](https://github.com/tada-alg/TADA): Data augmentation for learning from microbiome compositional data
    * [Niema](https://github.com/niemasd):
        * [FAVITES](https://github.com/niemasd/FAVITES): Simulation of HIV on social networks
        * [Dual-birth](https://github.com/niemasd/Dual-Birth-Model): a set of scripts to work with the dual-birth model
        * [TreeCluster](https://github.com/niemasd/TreeCluster): A tool for clustering leaves of phylogenetic tree in a principled way
        * [ProACT](https://github.com/niemasd/ProACT)
    * [Maryam Rabiee](https://github.com/maryamrabiee)
        * [INSTRAL](https://github.com/maryamrabiee/INSTRAL): A tool that extends ASTRAL for phylogenetic placement
