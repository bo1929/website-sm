title: Making my dissertation available
---

Since my dissertation is not to be found yet on the [UT library](http://www.lib.utexas.edu/gradstudents/finding-dissertations-theses-and-reports) and frankly
I am not sure how long they will need to make it available, I am making it available here: [Dissertation of Siavash Mirarab]({{ site.url }}/assets/siavashmirarab.pdf) 
The pdf shall be removed (or redirected) once UT officially uploads the dissertation.
