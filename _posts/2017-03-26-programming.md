title: Material for prospective students
---

Prospective students, especially those from ECE, typically need to improve their programming skills before 
they can do useful work in my lab. 
[Niema Moshiri]() has shared with me these suggestions for online material that students can use to brush up their 
coding and algorithmic skills.


* **Python**: Codecademy [Python Track](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python)

* **Data Structures**: Niema has his own [online textbook](https://stepik.org/course/Data-Structures-579)

* **Algorithms**: The online course by Sasha Kulikov with Pavel Pevzner, especially [the first course of the series](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox#syllabus)
    * Once at UCSD, students can take CSE 101 (undergrad algorithms) or CSE 202 (grad algorithms).
 
* **Bioinformatics**: Pavel Pevezner has several useful  MOOCs. The programming assignments might be a bit intense for new students (there's a lot of them, and they're fairly difficult). 
    * You can simply watch the [lecture videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/bioinfalgorithms/playlists?sort=dd&view=1&shelf_id=0) to learn about the biological problems and the bioinformatics algorithmic solutions. 
    * If you want to tackle the full-on course, you can take the [full online course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics).
    * If you are at UCSD, instead of taking the course online, you can take the in-person course (CSE 282), which would count for ECE students as a technical elective. 

* **R**: [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/getting-started?step=2&track=r)

* **Unix**: [Codecademy Unix Track](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)

* **Git**: [GitHub tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) and Codecademy Git Track (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)
