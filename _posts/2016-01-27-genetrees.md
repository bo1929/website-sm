title: Gene trees from species trees (NSF 1565862)
---

In this page, we will track our progress towards a project titled "Using genomic context to understand evolutionary histories of individual genes". 
The project will be supported by an NSF award, 1565862, starting July 2016. 

**Goal:** this project aims to improve gene tree estimation in the context of a given species tree. 
Thus, our aim is scalable and accurate estimation of gene trees given sequence data and the species tree, considering ILS as the gene evolution process and substitutions as the sequence evolution process.
We hope the knowledge of the species tree can reduce the gene tree estimation error. 
 
The main challenge is to do this in a scalable yet principled way. 
Our approaches from [ASTRAL](https://github.com/smirarab/ASTRAL), [DISTIQUE](https://github.com/esayyari/DISTIQUE), and other recent projects will be useful here. 
Also useful are some recent developments by others in the field in the related problem where duplication and loss generates discordance. 


Stay tuned for upcoming news about this project, and a more detailed description.
