title: Gene trees from species trees
---

In this page, we will track our progress towards a project titled "Using genomic context to understand evolutionary histories of individual genes". The basic idea is to infer gene trees given a species tree, and taking into account coalescent. The challenging part is to do this in a scalable yet principled way. Our approaches from ASTRAL, DISTIQUE, and other recent projects will be useful here. Also useful are some recent developments by others in the field in the related problem where duplication and loss generates discordance. Stay tuned for upcoming news about this project, and a more detailed description.
