Here, we gather the list of small corrections we have had to make to our papers through the years. May the list remain short:

* Zhang, Chao, Celine Scornavacca, Erin K Molloy, and Siavash Mirarab. “ASTRAL-Pro: Quartet-Based Species-Tree Inference despite Paralogy.” Molecular Biology and Evolution 37, no. 11 (2020): 3292–3307. [doi:10.1093/molbev/msaa139](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa139).
    * Published correction [here](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/10/4655/6355927)
* Sayyari, Erfan and Siavash Mirarab. “Fast coalescent-based computation of local branch support from quartet frequencies”. Molecular Biology and Evolution 33, no. 7 (2016): 1654-1668. [doi:10.1093/molbev/msw079](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msw079)
    * In the supplementary material, Proof of Lemma 1, Page 17, we had a small (if embarrasing) error where we wrote something akin to P(X)=P(X|Y)+P(X|¬Y) instead of P(X)=P(X,Y)+P(X,¬Y).
      The error did not impact anything because we actually needed the P(X)=P(X,Y)+P(X,¬Y) in the proof. The fixed version of the supplementary material is provided [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/msw079-supplementary-v2.pdf).
