title: Material for prospective students
---

Prospective students, especially those from ECE, typically wonder what kind of work my area of research entails. 
Here is some background reading material that can help:

* Read the first and second chapters from [dissertation]({{ site.url }}/assets/siavashmirarab.pdf). Also have a quick look at the reminder of the dissertation; should
give you an idea. 

* This evolving [textbook](http://tandy.cs.illinois.edu/textbook.pdf) from my former advisor, [Tandy Warnow](http://tandy.cs.illinois.edu/) is
a good resource to understand phylogeetics and multiple sequence alignment, two of the main topics of my work. 

* I also recommend the following two textbooks for understanding more about computational biology and bininformatics.
    * Jones, Neil C., and Pavel Pevzner. An introduction to bioinformatics algorithms. MIT press, 2004.
    * Durbin, R., Eddy, S. R., Krogh, A., & Mitchison, G. (1998). Biological sequence analysis: probabilistic models of proteins and nucleic acids. Cambridge university press.

  You can find these in the library, and I have a copy I could lend you for a short time. There are many more interesting textbooks, and you should feel free
to explore them. 

* Have a look at our [papers]({{ site.url }}/publications.html) on ASTRAL (#18 and #26), statistical binning (#22 and #25), and PASTA (#23) to understand our algorithmic work
and look at our two flagship papers on avian and plant evolution to get and idea about the collaborative work we do with biologists (see #21 and #22).

* I also invite you to have a quick look at publication from other researchers in this area. Contact me for a list of suggestions based on your interests.
