title: Joining UCSD
---

I am excited to join the [ECE](ece.ucsd.edu) department of UC - San Diego as an assistant professor. 
I have started officially since July 2015, and have been in the campus since the end of the July. 
If you are a UCSD graduate student, in ECE or other departments, and interested in working on computational biology, drop me an email.
