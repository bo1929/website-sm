abstract = {BackgroundInferring species trees from gene trees using the coalescent-based summary methods has been the subject of much attention, yet new scalable and accurate methods are needed. ResultsWe introduce DISTIQUE, a new statistically consistent summary method for inferring species trees from gene trees under the coalescent model. We generalize our results to arbitrary phylogenetic inference problems; we show that two arbitrarily chosen leaves, called anchors, can be used to estimate relative distances between all other pairs of leaves by inferring relevant quartet trees. This results in a family of distance-based tree inference methods, with running times ranging between quadratic to quartic in the number of leaves. ConclusionsWe show in simulated studies that DISTIQUE has comparable accuracy to leading coalescent-based summary methods and reduced running times.},

@article{TreeShrink,
	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer International Publishing AG. Phylogenetic trees include errors for a variety of reasons. We argue that one way to detect errors is to build a phylogeny with all the data then detect taxa that artificially inflate the tree diameter. We formulate an optimization problem that seeks to find k leaves that can be removed to reduce the tree diameter maximally. We present a polynomial time solution to this “k-shrink” problem. Given this solution, we then use non-parametric statistics to find an outlier set of taxa that have an unexpectedly high impact on the tree diameter. We test our method, TreeShrink, on five biological datasets, and show that it is more conservative than rogue taxon removal using RogueNaRok. When the amount of filtering is controlled, TreeShrink outperforms RogueNaRok in three out of the five datasets, and they tie in another dataset.},

@article{polytomy,
	abstract = {Phylogenetic species trees typically represent the speciation history as a bifurcating tree. Speciation events that simultaneously create more than two descendants, thereby creating polytomies in the phylogeny, are possible. Moreover, the inability to resolve relationships is often shown as a (soft) polytomy. Both types of polytomies have been traditionally studied in the context of gene tree reconstruction from sequence data. However, polytomies in the species tree cannot be detected or ruled out without considering gene tree discordance. In this paper, we describe a statistical test based on properties of the multi-species coalescent model to test the null hypothesis that a branch in an estimated species tree should be replaced by a polytomy. On both simulated and biological datasets, we show that the null hypothesis is rejected for all but the shortest branches, and in most cases, it is retained for true polytomies. The test, available as part of the Accurate Species TRee ALgorithm (ASTRAL) package, can help systematists decide whether their datasets are sufficient to resolve specific relationships of interest.},

@article{instral,
	abstract = {Phylogenomic analyses have increasingly adopted species tree reconstruction using methods that account for gene tree discordance using pipelines that require both effort and computational resources. As the number of available genomes continues to increase, a new problem is facing researchers. Once new species become available, they have to repeat the whole costly process from the beginning because updating available species trees is currently not possible. Such de-novo inference can be prohibitively costly in human effort or machine time. In this paper, we introduce INSTRAL, a method that extends ASTRAL to enable phylogenetic placement. INSTRAL is designed to add a new species onto an existing species tree after sequences from the new species have already been added to gene trees; thus, INSTRAL is complementary to existing placement methods such as pplacer and EPA that update gene trees with new sequences.},

@article{Moshiri2018,
	abstract = {Motivation: The ability to simulate epidemics as a function of model parameters allows for the gain of insights unobtainable from real datasets. Further, reconstructing transmission networks for fast-evolving viruses like HIV may have the potential to greatly enhance epidemic intervention, but transmission network reconstruction methods have been inadequately studied, largely because it is difficult to obtain "truth" sets on which to test them and properly measure their performance. Results: We introduce FAVITES, a robust framework for simulating realistic datasets for epidemics that are caused by fast-evolving pathogens like HIV. FAVITES creates a generative model that produces many items relevant to an epidemic, such as contact networks, transmission networks, phylogenetic trees, and error-prone sequence datasets. FAVITES is designed to be flexible and exhaustive by dividing the generative model into modules, each of which is expressed as a fixed API that can be implemented using various sub-models. We use FAVITES to simulate HIV datasets resembling the San Diego epidemic and show that the simulated datasets are realistic. We then use the simulated data to make inferences about the epidemic and how it is impact by increased treatment efforts. We also study two transmission network reconstruction methods and their effectiveness in detecting fast-growing clusters.},

@article{Skmerjournal,
	abstract = {The ability to quickly and inexpensively describe taxonomic diversity is critical in this era of rapid climate and biodiversity changes. The currently preferred molecular technique, barcoding, has been very successful, but is based on short organelle markers. Recently, an alternative genome-skimming approach has been proposed: low-pass sequencing (100Mb - several Gb per sample) is applied to voucher and/or query samples, and marker genes and/or organelle genomes are recovered computationally. The current practice of genome-skimming discards the vast majority of the data because the low coverage of genome-skims prevents assembling the nuclear genomes. In contrast, we suggest using all unassembled reads directly, but existing methods poorly support this goal. We introduce a new alignment-free tool, Skmer, to estimate genomic distances between the query and each reference genome-skim using the k-mer decomposition of reads. We test Skmer on a large set of insect and bird genomes, sub-sampled to create genome-skims. Skmer shows great accuracy in estimating genomic distances, identifying the closest match in a reference dataset, and inferring the phylogeny. The software is publicly available on https://github.com/shahab-sarmashghi/Skmer.git},
